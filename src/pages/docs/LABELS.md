A label is an `attribute` that can be added to anything but an `actor`.

There isn't much difference between `labels` and `tags` and the terms can be used interchangeably using `#newbie`.  However, a single thing may have 2 - 3 `labels` where as it might have 20 - 30 `tags`.

`Labels` can be comprised of `tags`.

 [!🎥: badTake] or complex reference? 
`Labels` can be displayed as a name value pair.

Come up with a better name for this.
