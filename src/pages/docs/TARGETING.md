## Targeting
To direct something to another `actor` or `thing`, simplely use @ symbol.
> ☶: +☶, @actor

> ☶: +☶ ---> @actor

This is _☶_ `expelling` _+☶_ to the `actor`.

Sometimes the `target` can be on the opposite `direction`, this could because more emphasis is put on the `actor` rather than the `reaction`.

> @actor <--- +☶

### Assumed Actor
If `☶` is _implicit_, it can be `documented` as _<-- +☶_.  

If the `action` is targeted towards the `documenter` it is common to used _assumed reactions_.

*Look, you freed up a little bit more time, now you can make the `movement` more _expressive_ and `granular`!*

Sometimes, while being `#concise`, it is not necessary be as `#detailed` `☶: +☶ @admin`.
