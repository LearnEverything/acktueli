## Targeting
To direct something to another `actor` or `thing`, simplely use @ symbol.
> ☶: +☶, @actor

> ☶: +☶ ---> @actor

This is _☶_ `expelling` _+☶_ to the `actor`.

Sometimes the `target` can be on the opposite `direction`, this could because more emphasis is put on the `actor` rather than the `reaction`.

> @actor <--- +☶
