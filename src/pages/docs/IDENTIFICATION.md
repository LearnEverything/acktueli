## Identification
> ☶: ☶, I am a mountain.

### Identification
I, the Acktueli documenter, use _☶_ as my `identification` in this documentation.  `Actors` can choose any `identification` they want by representing themselves by any glyph.  However using `reserved characters` such as `+, -, ?` is considered `#rude`.

#### Acknowledgement
The `~` as a status can also represent a new `actor` to conversation.  The reason why it is reused is that, either way, in most cases the `actor` has not been fully `acknowledged`.
