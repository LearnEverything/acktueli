Tone is a very nuanced part of language so there are a few ways to express it.  Watch your tone.

Use of `meta`:
> {☴} [☴: +☴, I missed the train, but found a 20 dollar bill.]

Because of the speed at which `tone` might change in a sentense, it's helpful to use the `short` notation.   `Short` notation is limited to two characters, but can be placed anywhere in the `context`.
