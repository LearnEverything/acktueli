## TONE
Tone is a very nuanced part of language so there are a few ways to express it.  Watch your tone.

Use of `meta`, {☴} [☴: +☴, I missed the train, but found a 20 dollar bill.]

Because of the speed at which `tone` might change in a sentense, it's helpful to use the `short` notation. 

`Short` notation is limited to two characters, but can be placed anywhere in the `context`.

I think this is a good idea:), so what do you think about it:).

The directionality is _assumed_.

It doesn't always have to use `clipart` but you can use a number system for example 1 - 4
> . : .: ::
Just make sure it's two characters otherwise, a documenter can use the `avatar notation`.

#### Overtone
Overtone uses the `short` syntax usually.
