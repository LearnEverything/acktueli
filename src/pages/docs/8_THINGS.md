## Things
`Things` cannot produce `reactions` unless they are _personified_.  However, `things` can have histories that can affect their qualititive aspects.  `Things` also don't mind if you quantify them in different ways.  All `things` have a `parent`, but they don't get in trouble if they aren't implicit. Just because the `thing` is by itself, doesn't mean that it is alone.

### Thing Indicators
Both the qualitative and quantiative are usually put on the left, as `things` usually don't send `mood`.

15 [+]ðŸ‘€ - 15 kinda good eyeballs

### Showing parent
15 [+ðŸ‘€]^â˜´ - the `actor` _â˜´_ is the `parent` of 15 kinda good eyeballs 

> Also can be notated as @ in `casual` instead of ^.  The speration between the `thing` and the `parent` become unclear.

### Obvious and Clarification
Sometimes, the `reaction` needs to be made more `obvious` and can denote something with `* *`.

_â˜¶/x+ *not amused, but go ahead and make an ass of yourself*

++â˜¶?[+] *amused and cautiously optomistic*

Othertimes, the `reaction` needs to be made more `clear`.

++â˜¶ { Laughing out loud }.

### Thing Movement
1 very small forehead kiss to admin

(a)admin<--- [+ã€ ]^2â˜´

Notice the anchor point is attached to admin to show a quick pocketing of that special forehead kiss.

### Status vs Static
Statuses are always static, but static isn't always status.  The fact that every `thing` has a `parent` is a `static` property of that `thing`.

### Thing Content
Sometimes, you can `resolve` content from `things annonymously` meaning, there isn't a known `actor` that produced the `content`.  Because of the nature of this, it's best to keep it `casual`.

^thing <--- â˜¶

^thing ---> thing content

^thing content <--- admin

^thing content ---> content from thing content

The arrows signify how hard of a `pull` this is, like trying to drink a thick milkshake.
