### MEtA notation?
Meta information can be inside with a [ ] or with { }.

### Obvious and Clarification
Sometimes, the `reaction` needs to be made more `obvious` and can denote something with `* *`.

_â˜¶/x+ *not amused, but go ahead and make an ass of yourself*

++â˜¶?[+] *amused and cautiously optomistic*

Othertimes, the `reaction` needs to be made more `clear`.

++â˜¶ { Laughing out loud }.

### I'm too lazy to find the emoji

### Status vs Static
Statuses are always static, but static isn't always status.

### Thing Content
Sometimes, you can `resolve` content from `things annonymously` meaning, there isn't a known `actor` that produced the `content`.  Because of the nature of this, it's best to keep it `casual`.

^thing <--- â˜¶

^thing ---> thing content

^thing content <--- admin

^thing content ---> content from thing content

The arrows signify how hard of a `pull` this is, like trying to drink a thick milkshake.
