The goal of Acktueli is to create a syntax for △.

This is an example of a typical line: `☶: +☶`

The basic syntax is broken down into two statements: 
On the left, `☶:`, is the `actor` statement,
And on the right, `+☶`, is the `mood` statement.
The `:` in `☶:` is just the dilimeter character between the `actor` and the `mood`

Often, the `actor` and the `mood` statement will repeat the same glyph like `☶` in `☶: +☶`.  This is because the mood of the actor must be thought in the context of the actor, for example one actor's very bad might just be another actor's bad.

Sometimes, there will be no `actor statement`, these are global messages, just assume it's probably something important.

## `=== actually ===`

Typically, actors can be represented by any glyph, however it is considered rude to use glyphs that are commonly used as indicators, ie `(+, -, _)`.

The mood of `☶` reminds me of some grunt from some 90s era sitcom.
