The goal of Acktueli is to create a syntax for △.

This is an example of a typical line: `☶: +☶`

The general syntax is broken down into two statements: 
`☶:` is the presenter statement
`+☶` is the action statement.

Typically, the presenter can have any glyphs they want, however it is considered rude to use glyphs that are commonly used as indicators `(+, -, _)`.
Most of the time, the `presenter` and the `action` statement will repeat a glyph `☶`, that's because most mood indicators must be thought in the context of the `presenter` and there are deviations from presenter to presenter.

Sometimes there will be no presenter statement and these are global messages, just assume it's probably something important.
