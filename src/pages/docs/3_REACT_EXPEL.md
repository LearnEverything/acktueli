### React and Expel

## React
-☶, an unhappy reaction

## Expel

When `expelation` is more `reflexive`, this means that seeing indicators of both sides of the `avatar` means it's more `sequential`, but if you see a `@` that means it's always `addressed`.

-☶- @admin, an unhappy reaction, but also expels negativity to admin

### Waves
(( admin )) chilling out

{{ admin }} stressing out

({ admin )) admin was stressing out a little, but admin chills things out a bit

### Questioning

`?` questioning

?--☶ *questioning* very unhappiness

### Anonymous Reaction
Sometimes, while being `concise`, it is not necissary to `☶: +☶ @admin`.  If `☶` is _implicit_, then you can write that as `<-- +☶`.  Look you freed up a little bit more time, now you can make the `movement` more `expressive`!
