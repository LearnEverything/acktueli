## Direction
To direct something to another `actor` or `thing`, simplely use @ symbol.

### anchor and motion
`<<` anchor
`-=` motion

`<=-<=-=<` In this statement, you see there is not a definate anchor, so that might indicate more persistance, or even an unwillingnes for an `actor` to clear the stage for another `reaction`.

☶ `<<=-=- ☶`, the arrow is usually an expressive form to show rapidness, strength and directionality of the movement.

When transitioning to something else, sometimes there is a speed up or slow down that needs to be recorded.

When you take the time to show movement, it's good to highly resolve this.

<-- generic movement

<------- quick traveling, possibly light hearted movement

<<<==== a strong delivery, strong connection

({ admin } <<--- quick light hearted movement of a thing that admin might not be prepared for

The movement arrows can be a more expressive subsitution for @, but not commonly used in basic statements.

### Address
`^` Similar to reference and value in programming.
@admin //admin proper
^admin //the place where admin is at, or admin's home
