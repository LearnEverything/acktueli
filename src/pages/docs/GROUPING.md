## Grouping

## Grouping with {, (, or [ 
Depending on which { } vs [ ] vs ( ) is used, these can have different semantic changes to the datastructure.  Sometimes, however, they have no semantic change, it just makes everything clearer to read... use sparingly.

{ -☶, -☶ } indicates _simultaneous_

[ -☶, ☶+ ] indicates _sequential_

also [ -☶.. ☶ ] using the more specific time interval notation

*messy people don't put spaces between their brackets and their statements*

## Generic References within Groups
The brackets here represent one `member` of a `group`.  `Context` is important, because here, one `actor` of is muting another `actor` of ☶.  Otherwise this statement could mean that the group [☶] mutes itself.
