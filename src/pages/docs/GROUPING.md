## Grouping

### Generic References within Groups
> 3:18 AM [☶] adds +m to [☶]
The brackets here represent one `actor` of a `group`.  `Context` is important, because here, one `actor` of is muting another `actor` of the `group` ☶.  Otherwise this statement could mean that the group [☶] mutes itself.

### Grouping with #
#☶ this could indicate a group for ☶.  #[☶]  This means a group for the group ☶.

### Grouping Actions
`Grouping` can be notated with any closure `closure` however, { } vs [ ] vs ( ) all have can _semantic_ affects when used to `group` `actions`.

{ -☶, -☶ } indicates _simultaneous_

[ -☶, ☶+ ] indicates _sequential_

also [ -☶.. ☶ ] using the more specific time interval notation

*messy people don't put spaces between their brackets and their statements*
