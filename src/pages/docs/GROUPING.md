## Grouping

### Multiples
☶ can be one person or multiple `#secretive` people
☶☶ can be two or a group of people
☶☶☶ can be three or a large crowd

Both ☶ and admin have a `reaction` of ☶...
> `#detailed` verison: ☶, admin: ☶

> `#secretive` version: ☶☶: ☶

Also `multiples` can be represented with `groups` denoted by [☶] or a specific amount 2[☶].

## Grouping with {, (, or [ 
Depending on which { } vs [ ] vs ( ) is used, these can have different semantic changes to the datastructure.  Sometimes, however, they have no semantic change, it just makes everything clearer to read... use sparingly.

{ -☶, -☶ } indicates simultaneious

[ -☶, ☶+ ] indicates sequential

also [ -☶.. ☶ ] using the more specific time interval notation

*messy people don't put spaces between their brackets and their statements*

## Generic References within Groups
The brackets here represent one `member` of a `group`.  `Context` is important, because here, one `actor` of is muting another `actor` of ☶.  Otherwise this statement could mean that the group [☶] mutes itself.
