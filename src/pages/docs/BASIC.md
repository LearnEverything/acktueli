## ☶ Acktueli ☶
*Hey, ☶, are you ready to learn some basics?*
> ☶: +☶, yup!

This _☶: +☶, yup!_, is a `$single` `line` of typically structured Acktueli. This `line` is broken down into two components.
> actor: action

In the example: _:_ in _☶:_ is the `ending character` of the `actor` component and signifies than an `action` component will follow.

In this case, the specific type of `action` portrayed is a `reaction`.  The _+_ in the `action` component is an `modifer`, meaning that this _\_+☶_ indicates a positive `reaction`.    And lastly the `content` component, _yup_.

> _=== Technically ===_, everything is a `reaction`, but not everything is an `action`. 

## `=== actually ===`

Sometimes, there are `actions` without an `actor`; these could be global messages, _just assume it's probably something important_.
