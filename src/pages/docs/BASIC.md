## ☶ Acktueli ☶

> 11:11 PM ☶: +☶, yay!

This is an example of a typical line: `☶: +☶, yay!`

This line is broken down into three component: 
On the left, _☶:_, is the `actor` component,  and on the right, _+☶_, is the `action` component.  In this case, the specific type of `action` portrayed is a `reaction`.  The _+_ in the `reaction` is an `indicator`, meaning that this _\_+☶_ indicates a positive `reaction`.  In the example: _:_ in _☶:_ is the ending character of the `actor` component and signifies than an `action` component will follow.  And lastly the `content` component, _yay_.

> _=== Technically ===_, everything is a `reaction`, but not everything is an `action`. 

Sometimes, there is `content` with no `actor` component; these are global messages, _just assume it's probably something important_.

## `=== actually ===`
