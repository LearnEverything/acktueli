## ◫ Acktueli ◫
First, we start off with a good `mood`: _+☶_.

*Hey, ☶, are you ready to learn some basics?*
> ☶: +☶, yup!

This _☶: +☶, yup!_, is a `$single` `line` of typically structured Acktueli. This `line` is broken down into a two main components.
> actor: action

In the example: _:_ in _☶:_ is the `ending character` of the `actor` component and signifies than an `action` component will follow.

In this case, the type of `action` portrayed is a `reaction`.  The _+_ in the `action` component is a `modifer` which generally symbolizes _increase_ or _good_.  And lastly the `content` component, _yup_.

## `=== actually ===`

> _=== Technically ===_, everything is a `reaction`, but not everything is an `action`. 

Sometimes, there are `actions` without an `actor`; these could be global messages, _just assume it's probably something important_.
