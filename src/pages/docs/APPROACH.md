## Approach
Different `approaches` can be used with Acktueli.  It is helpful if there is a consensus on `approach`, whether _explicit_ or _implicit_.

### `Polite`
Usually the first `approach` to be taken.  Sometimes it's only best to record `positive reactions` at first.  Also, it might be good to also use the `secretive` approach, but don't mention it.

### `Reserved`
Sometimes, Acktueli has a conflict with namespacing or use of glyphs with other platforms.  Symbols like _@_ can be changed to _(a)_ to better fit in with these systems.

### `Newbie`
Just a lot of clarification and `clipart`.

### `Casual` 
Sometimes you want to just want to use a little bit more `clipart` because things get boring.  Feel free to cast some spells and cause drama.

### `Artistic`
Heavy use of `clipart` to the point where it might not carry any semantic value but be for pure aethetic qualities.

### `Rude`

### `Detailed`
Depending on conversation speed, more detail can be recorded.  

### `Fast`
Good for rapidly incoming messages.  Uses a lot of `quick`, so best to let people know before hand.

### `Secretive`
The `actor` might want all their `reaction` recorded.  So sometimes you have to think, how would the `actor` like this obfuscated?  Using just an `afirmative` or a `positve afirmative` `reaction` can get the point across.  It might be expected for any `quick` to be removed after the conversation is over.

### `Concise`

### Combinations
New `Approaches` can be added or existing `approaches` can be combined with each other.  Sometimes, While selecting the `fast approach`,  the `rude approach` is also _implicitly_ defined.
