## Approach
While `documenting` Acktueli, different `approaches` can be used.  It is helpful to know the consensus on `approach`, whether _explicit_ or _implicit_.  Depending on the `approach`, Acktueli can have different language and communication rules.  Look for the `#` in this documentation as this will show that there might be an `approach` to consider.

### `#polite`
Usually the first `approach` to be taken.  Document only `positive reactions` at first!!  Also, it may be good to be `#secretive`, but don't mention it.. shhh.  Lastly, try to keep the `volume` low.

### `#coding`
If open curly braces aren't the `reader` or `documenter's` thing, then a less `#artistic` `approach` can be taken with certain programming syntax conventions... expecially when `documenting` `grouping`, `attribute` and `labels` with the `characters` _({[_.

### `#reserved`
Acktueli's characters can cause conflicts with other platforms, an easy way to get around this might to prefix with `\`.  Other symbols like _@_ can be represented as to _(a)_ to have less conflicts these systems.

### `#newbie`
Just a lot of clarification, `clipart`, and a lot of rule breaking.

### `#casual` 
Sometimes you want to just want to use a little bit more `clipart` because things get boring.  Feel free to cast some spells and make drama, but try not to be `#rude`.

### `#artistic`
Heavy use of `clipart` for pure aethetic qualities to the point where it might not carry any semantic meaning.

### `#rude`

### `#detailed`
Depending on conversation speed, more detail can be documented.

### `#fast`
Good for rapidly incoming messages.  Uses a lot of `quick`, so best to let people know before hand.

### `#secretive`
The `actor` might not want all their `actions` documented.  Sometimes care must be taken to obfuscate, how would the `actor` like this?  Using just an `afirmative` or a `positve afirmative` `reaction` can get the point across.  It might be expected for any `quick` to be removed after the conversation is over.

### Combinations
New `Approaches` can be added or existing `approaches` can be combined with each other.  Sometimes, while being `#fast`, taking the `#rude` approach is also _implicitly_ defined.
