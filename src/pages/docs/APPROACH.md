## Approach
While `documenting` Acktueli, different `approaches` can be used.  It is helpful to have a consensus on `approach`, whether  _explicit_ or _implicit_.  Depending on the `approach`, Acktueli can have different language and communication rules.

◫ Look for the `#` in this documentation as this will show that there might be an `approach` to consider.

### Extensibility
New `Approaches` can be added or existing `approaches` can be combined with each other.  Sometimes, while being `#fast`, taking the `#rude` `approach` is also _implicitly_ defined.    Also, depending on the `documenter` or use case, there might be some `approaches` not listed here because Acktueli was extended with a new `approach`.

### `#polite`
Usually the first `approach` to be taken.  Perhaps this mgiht mean to document only `positive reactions` at first!!  Also, it may be good to be `#secretive`, but don't mention it.. shhh.  Lastly, try to keep the `loud noises` at bay.

### `#coding`
If open curly braces aren't the `reader` or `documenter's` thing, then a less `#artistic` `approach` can be taken with certain programming syntax conventions... expecially when `documenting` `grouping`, `attribute` and `labels` with the `characters` _({[_.

### `#reserved`
Acktueli's characters can cause conflicts with other platforms, an easy way to get around this might to prefix with `\`.  Other symbols like _@_ can be represented as to _(a)_ to have less conflicts these systems.

### `#newbie`
A lot of clarification, `clipart`, a lot of rule breaking and name calling.

### `#casual` 
In some situations, being `#polite` might be insulting, and a `documenter` might want to be a little bit more `#casual`.  A `documenter` want to just want to use a little bit more `clipart` because the conversation is boring.  Feel free to cast some spells and make drama, but try not to be `#rude`.

### `#artistic`
Heavy use of `clipart` for pure aethetic qualities to the point where it might not carry any semantic meaning.

### `#interactive`
This focuses on making the `documentation` more `interactive`.  Maybe the documenter make take a `survey` or add some `gamification`.

### `#detailed`
Depending on conversation speed, more detail can be documented.  Getting the right `change over time` shape might take some time to get just right.

### `#fast`
Good for rapidly incoming messages.  Uses a lot of `quick`, so best to let people know before hand before it gets out of hand.

### `#secretive`
The `actor` might not want all their `conversation` documented.  Sometimes care must be taken to obfuscate, and the `documenter` has to think, "how would the `actor` like this"?  Sometimes, using just an `afirmative` or a `positve afirmative` `reaction` can get the point across.  In some instances, it might be expected for any `quick` to be removed after a conversation is `documented`.

### `#concise`
