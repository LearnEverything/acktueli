## Permanance
There is different types of `permanance`.

### `<single>`
`Permance` that lasts within the time period of a single line of communication.  This is the default `permanance` unless otherwise specified.

### `<permanant>`
`Permanant` is the rarest type as everything changes.

### `<semi-permant>`
An `actor` can get a car and then sell the car.

### `<lasting>`
An `actor` can have a lasting impression.

### `<interval>`
A specific amount of time passing.  Most `<single>` `actions` also have `<interval>` `permanance`, because it is known how much time passed before the pervious `action` and the next `action`.

### `<wave>`
A back and forth variation that is usually just `<lasting>` and rarely `<semi-permanent>`.
