## Tags
Tags usually provide clear insight or act as a borrowed syntax from another language or can be used to increase the readability to humans or robots.

### Obvious and Clarification
Sometimes, the `reaction` needs to be made more `#obvious` and can denote something with `* *`.  Othertimes, the `reaction` needs to be made more `clear`.  Usually, `documenting` subtext makes things more clear, but to have further documentation without `tone` assumptions, one can use the `{}`.
