## ☶ Acktueli ☶

> 11:11 PM ☶: +☶, yay!

This is an example of a typical line: `☶: +☶, yay!`

The basic syntax is broken down into three components: 
On the left, _☶:_, is the `actor` component,  and on the right, _+☶_, is the `action` component.  In this case, the specific type of action portrayed is a `reaction`.  The _+_ in the `reaction` is an `indicator`, meaning that this _\_+☶_ indicates a positive `reaction`.  In the example: _:_ in _☶:_ is the ending character of the `actor` statment and signifies than an `action` component will follow.  And lastly the `content` component, _yay_.

> _=== Technically ===_, everything is a `reaction`, but not everything is an `action`. 

Often, the `actor` and the `reaction` statement will repeat the same glyph _☶_ like in `_☶: +☶`.  This is because the `reaction` of the `actor` is _reflexive_, in other words, it must be thought in the `context` of the `actor`, for example, one actor's sad might just be another actor's normal :.

Sometimes, there will be no `actor statement`; these are global messages, _just assume it's probably something important_.

## `=== actually ===`

> `Actors` can represent themselves with any glyph, however using `reserved` characters such as `+, -, ?` is considered scandelous.

### Intensity
"☶" as a `reaction` can mean many different things.  However, most of the time it is used as some basic acknowledgement.  An example is just think if someone asked you a question, and to say yes or no, you said your name, like a pokemon.

Pikachu:

`☶ *pika*`

`☶☶ *pikapikapiiika*`

`++☶☶☶ *pikaachooooooo!*`
