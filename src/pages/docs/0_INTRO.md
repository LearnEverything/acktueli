## ☶ Acktueli ☶

This is an example of a typical line: `☶: +☶`

The basic syntax is broken down into two statements: 
On the left, `☶:`, is the `actor` statement,
And on the right, `+☶`, is the `mood` statement.
The `:` in `☶:` is just the dilimeter character between the `actor` and the `mood`

Often, the `actor` and the `mood` statement will repeat the same glyph like `☶` in `☶: +☶`.  This is because the `mood of the actor` must be thought in the `context` of the `actor`, for example one actor's sad might just be another actor's normal :.

Sometimes, there will be no `actor statement`, these are global messages, just assume it's probably something important.

## `=== actually ===`

> Typically, `actors` can be represent themselves by any glyph, however it is considered rude to use glyphs that are commonly used as `indicators`, ie `(+, -, _)`.
