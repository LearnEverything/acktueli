## Approach
Different `approaches` can be used with Acktueli.  It is helpful if there is a consensus on `approach`, whether _explicit_ or _implicit_.

### `polite`
Usually the first `approach` to be taken.  Sometimes it's only best to record `positive reactions` at first.  Also, it might be good to also use the `secretive` approach, but don't mention it.

### `newbie`
Just a lot of clarification and `expressive visual indicators`.

### `casual` 
Sometimes you want to just want to use a little bit more `expressive visual indicators` because things get boring.  Feel free to cast some spells and cause drama.

### `rude`

### `detailed`
Depending on conversation speed, more detail can be recorded.  

### `fast`
Good for rapidly incoming messages.  Uses a lot of `quick`, so best to let people know before hand.

### `secretive`
The `actor` might want all their `reaction` recorded.  So sometimes you have to think, how would the `actor` like this obfuscated?  Using just an `afirmative` or a `positve afirmative` `reaction` can get the point across.
