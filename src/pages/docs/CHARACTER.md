## Character
Single characters can have a `composible` `semantic`, or in series, can have`expressive` impact on the meaning on the `action`.

When the characters are an `expressive series`, this can vary signifigantly in Acktueli.  `Expressive` characters used can be different `qualitative` representations, however it is not `#detailed` to use them as `quantitative` representations.

For instance, there might not be much variation in what `+` means... but `+.+`... is that a clown or a beached squid?

Depending on Acktueli, there also might be certain characters used in the `#acktueli` version that mess up all kinds of stuff for other people or there is characters used beyond what `#actueli` defines.

#### Acceptable Arrow Characters
`<{[(`

Depending on which _domain_ you are working in, arrows can represent different things.  `(=` can represent a convex lense on a video camera to zoom in.
