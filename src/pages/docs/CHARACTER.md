## Character
Before we take a deep dive and look at all the features of Acktueli, let's take a second to look at the visual impact some characters might have.  Since this might be different from place to place, the character sets used can be different for `qualitative` representations... but usually not for `quantitative` representations.

For instance, there might not be much variation in what `+` means... but `+.+`... is that a clown or a pokemon being captured?

Depending on Acktueli, there also might be certain characters used in the `#acktueli` version that mess up all kinds of stuff for other people or there is characters used beyond what `#actueli` defines.

#### Acceptable Arrow Characters
`<{[(`

Depending on which _domain_ you are working in, arrows can represent different things.  `(=` can represent a convex lense on a video camera to zoom in.
