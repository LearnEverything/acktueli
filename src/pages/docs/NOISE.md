## Noise
Often, situations can get `noisey`.

## Loudest Noise
Without listening for any `action`, the recorder can direct their attention to a `thing` or `actor` and record any `noises` that are picked up.  Sometimes, it's a lot, sometimes it's a little, but in either situation the `loudest noise` will get recorded.

This is basically `resolving` `annonymous` `attributes` or `content` from `things` using loudest wins meaning.  Because the focus is to listen for the `loudest noise`, often the `actor` is not known, which is why we call it call `annonymous`.  Because of the nature of this, it's best to keep it `#casual`.
