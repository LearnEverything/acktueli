## Things
`Things` cannot produce `reactions` unless they are _personified_.  However, `things` can have histories that can affect their qualititive aspects.  `Things` also don't mind if you quantify them in different ways.  Most `things` are an attribute of an `actor`, but they don't get in trouble if they aren't _implicit_. Just because the `thing` is by itself, doesn't mean that it is alone.

`Things` also don't have _reflexive_ properties.

### Thing Indicators
Both the qualitative and quantiative are usually put on the left, as `things` usually don't send `mood`.

15 [+]ðŸ‘€ - 15 kinda good eyeballs

### Things as an Attribute 
15 â˜´[+ðŸ‘€] - the `actor` _â˜´_ is the `parent` of 15 kinda good eyeballs 

> Also can be notated as @ in `casual` instead of ^.  The speration between the `thing` and the `parent` become unclear.

### Thing Movement

Notice the anchor point is attached to admin to show a quick pocketing of that special forehead kiss.

### Status vs Static
Statuses are always static, but static isn't always status.  The fact that every `thing` has a `parent` is a `static` property of that `thing`.
