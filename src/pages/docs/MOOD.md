## Mood
Anything can have a `mood`.

#### Things
Things, are somewhat _personified_ in that they can have a `mood`, but do not have the _reflexive_ `avatar`.  It's also notated without the `avatar` because the typical `permanance` of `mood` of a `thing` is `$semi-permanance` while `actors` are quite a bit more moody.
