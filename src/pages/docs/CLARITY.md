## Clarity
All to often, while documenting another `actors` responses, there can be other `actors` with unfamiliar signals, or  the message's signal strength is weak.  Acktueli donotes this by using the `~`.

  Most of the time, there is no `lasting` property to `actors` who produce `noises`.  An `actor statement` will be previxed by a `~` in the conversation, otherwise, their `status` and `identification` would be documented.

`~☶`, I think this is ☶, but not sure

`~~~` this is very unclear

~☶ The presenter can be unclear, 
☶: ~☶ the mood they have can be unclear or 
☶: ~[+-]☶ certain small parts of the mood can be unclear.  
To make these unclear mood indicators very tiny use [[ ]] ~[[+-]]☶, 

> Only using [ ] to denote this might not be considered not `( Detailed )`.

### As a status
When used as `status`, it could indicate an `actor` don't like how you identify them or they are new to your conversation and you need to `resolve` them a little better.
