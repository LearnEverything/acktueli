## Status
So far, we've seen `reaction` as a type of `action`, but sometimes the `documenter` needs to describe the `actors` state of being or `status`.  Knowing the `status` will help the `reader` better understand the `context` of the `actor`.

### Reaction vs Status
What is the difference between a state of being and a flash of emotion?  Just a difference in `$interval` length.  An `actor's mood` is `$lasting`.  The `$lasting` is a type of `permanance` we'll call `status`.  

We'll assume the actor is reacting in the context of these `$lasting reaction`.

When an `actor` changes their `attributes` during `documentation`, it is can arrive as a `global message`.

> â˜¶ changes their `status` to `||â˜¶`.

> However, using typical `status modifiers` as `action modifiers` can indicate at little `unchill` _{ {_.

The `â˜¶` actor is...

`/â˜¶` stuck

`|â˜¶` busy

`*â˜¶` eager

If an `actor` is being documented, sometimes they do not like their `identification`.

### Status Symmetry
Sometimes, to emphasize a balanced or imbalanced `mood`, an `actor's` `status` can be represented as a `$wave`.  The left, could be the max and the right can be the min of the `$wave`.  

> ++â˜¶++

Nice and balanced.

> { ++â˜¶-- }

This `actors` status might be going back and forth between positive and negative.  The use of waves help also indicate that this is a `$wave` and that going back and forth between positive and negative is probably a stressful experience.
