## Status
So far, we've seen `reaction` as a type of `action`, but sometimes we need to describe their state of being or `status`.  Knowing the `status` will help us better understand the `context` of the `actor`.

### Reaction vs Status
What is the difference between the state of being and a flash of emotion?  Just a difference in `<interval>` length.  An actor's mood is `<lasting>`.  The `<lasting>` is a type of `permanance` we'll call `status`.  

We'll assume the actor is reacting in the context of these `$lasting reaction`.

When an `actor` changes their `attributes` in a conversation, it is can arrive as a `global message`: â˜¶ changes their `status` to `||â˜¶`.

> However, using typical `status indicators` as `action indicators` can indicate _{ {_.

The `â˜¶` actor is...

`/â˜¶` stuck

`|â˜¶` busy

`*â˜¶` eager

If an `actor` is being documented, sometimes they do not like their `identification`.

### Status Symmetry
Seldomly, an `actor's` `status` can be represented as a `$wave`.  The left, could be the max and the right can be the min of the `$wave`.  `Reactions` are never `$waves` because of it's type of `permanance`.

Nice and balanced.

This `actors` status might be going back and forth between positive and negative.  The use of waves help also indicate that this is a `$wave` and that going back and forth between positive and negative is probably a stressful experience.
