## Status
So far, we've seen `reaction` as a type of `action`, but sometimes we need to describe their state of being or `status`.  Knowing the `status` will help us better understand the `context` of the `actor`.

### Reaction vs Status
What is the difference between the state of being and a flash of emotion?  Just a difference in `<interval>` length.  An actor's mood is `<lasting>`.  The `<lasting>` is a type of `permanance` we'll call `status`.  

We'll assume the actor is reacting in the context of these `$lasting reaction`.

When `Static Modifiers` are used in a conversation, it is can arrive as a `global message`: ☶ changes their status to `||☶`.

> However, using `static modifiers` as a reaction can indicate { {.

The `☶` actor is...

`/☶` stuck

`|☶` busy

`*☶` eager

If an `actor` is being documented, sometimes they do not like their `identification`.
