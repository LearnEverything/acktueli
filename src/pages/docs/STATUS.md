### Presenter Modifiers
These aren't typically used in normal conversations, if anything the presenter would make a reference to their status indication which contains these glyphs.

/☶ stuck

|☶ busy

*☶ eagerness

### Clarity
~ sometimes things aren't too clear

~☶, I think this is ☶, but not sure

~~~ this is very unclear

~☶ The presenter can be unclear, 
☶: ~☶ the mood they have can be unclear or 
☶: ~[+-]☶ certain small parts of the mood can be unclear.  
To make these unclear mood indicators very tiny use [[ ]] ~[[+-]]☶, however only using [ ] to denote this might not be considered rude.
