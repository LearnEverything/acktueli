## Status

So far, we've seen `reaction` as a type of `action`, but sometimes we need to describe their state of being or `status`.  Knowing the `status` will help us better understand the `context` of the `actor`.

### Reaction vs Status
What is the difference between the state of being and a flash of emotion?  Just a difference in `time interval`.  An actor's mood is `<lasting>`.  The `<lasting>` is a type of `timing` we'll call `status`.  

We'll assume the actor is reacting in the context of these `<lasting> reaction`.

When `Static Modifiers` are used in a conversation, it is can arrive as a `global message`: â˜¶ changes their status to `||â˜¶`.

> However, using `static modifiers` as a reaction can indicate { {.

The `â˜¶` actor is...

`/â˜¶` stuck

`|â˜¶` busy

`*â˜¶` eager

If an `actor` is being recorded, sometimes they do not like their identification.

### Status Annotation
```
~â˜¶ [
  â˜¶: I'm busy
  â˜¶: I'm very busy
]
```
This means that all `actions` from the `actor` _â˜¶_, must be interpreted through the context of the `status` listed at the begining.  Often when this is present, the underlying `context` is acertained at a later moment of the `actions` that it describes.
