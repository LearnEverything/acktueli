### React and Expel

## React
-☶, an unhappy reaction

## Expel
When `expelation` is more _reflexive_, this means that seeing indicators of both sides of the `avatar` means it's more _sequential_, but if you see a `@` that means it's always `addressed`.

-☶- @admin, an unhappy `reaction`, but also expels negativity to admin

### Waves
(( admin )) chilling out

{{ admin }} stressing out

({ admin )) admin was stressing out a little, but admin chills things out a bit

### Implicit Reaction
If `☶` is _implicit_, then you can write that as _<-- +☶_.  Look, you freed up a little bit more time, now you can make the `movement` more _expressive_ and `granular`!

Sometimes, while being `#concise`, it is not necessary be as `#detailed` `☶: +☶ @admin`.
