## React and Expel
While documenting, there is always a `acting` `actor` and an `targeted` `actor` .  First an `actor` `reacts` internally to a preceeding `action` and then either externalizes that reaction to the `targeted` `actor`, or has a `change` in `mood` after a bit of conscious thinking. The `targeted` `actor` can be _implicit_ or _explicit_.  

> +☶, the world is good.

_Implicit_ `targeted` `actor`, the world.


### React
-☶, an unhappy reaction

### Expel
There doesn't always have to be a change of `mood` between a `react` and `expel`, but there is always _sequentiality_.  Often, the `expel` component is _explicit_.

> ☶: +☶

`Actor` `reacts` positively but also `expels` an `explicit` `positive` `mood`.

If you see a `@` that means `targeted` or specifically `addressed`.

> -☶- @document0r, an unhappy `reaction`, but also `expels` negativity to @document0r.

### Waves
(( document0r )) chilling out

{{ document0r }} stressing out

({ act0r )) act0r was stressing out a little, but act0r chills things out a bit

### Assumed Actor
If `☶` is _implicit_, it can be `documented` as _<-- +☶_.  

If the `action` is targeted towards the `documenter` it is common to used _assumed reactions_.

*Look, you freed up a little bit more time, now you can make the `movement` more _expressive_ and `granular`!*

Sometimes, while being `#concise`, it is not necessary be as `#detailed` `☶: +☶ @admin`.
