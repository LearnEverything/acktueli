## Status

So far, we've seen `reaction` as a type of `action`, but sometimes we need to describe their state of being or `status`.  Knowing the `status` will help us better understand the `context` of the `actor`.

### Status vs Static


### Reaction vs Status
What is the difference between the state of being and a flash of emotion?  Just a difference in `time interval`.  An actor's mood is `lasting`.  The `lasting` is a type of `timing` we'll call `status`.  

We'll assume the actor is reacting in the context of these `lasting reaction`.

When `Static Modifiers` are used in a conversation, it is can arrive as a `global message`: ☶ changes their status to `||☶`.

> However, using `static modifiers` as a reaction can indicate { {.

The `☶` actor is...

`/☶` stuck

`|☶` busy

`*☶` eager

### Clarity

Sometimes things aren't too clear, or .

`~` 

When used as `status`, it could indicate they don't like how you identify them or they are new to your conversation and you need to `resolve` them a little better.  Most of the time, there is no `lasting` to `noises` and somone getting the `~` unclear in the conversation, otherwise, you'd add them to the room and record their status elsewhere.

`~☶`, I think this is ☶, but not sure

`~~~` this is very unclear

~☶ The presenter can be unclear, 
☶: ~☶ the mood they have can be unclear or 
☶: ~[+-]☶ certain small parts of the mood can be unclear.  
To make these unclear mood indicators very tiny use [[ ]] ~[[+-]]☶,
