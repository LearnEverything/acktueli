## Static Mood
Sometimes, an actor's mood is `lasting`.  The `lasting` is a type of `permanance` we'll call `static`.  We'll assume the actor is reacting in the context of these `lasting moods`.

When `Static Modifiers` are used in a conversation, it is can arrive as a `global message` ☶ changes their status to `||☶`.

> However, using `static modifiers` as a reaction can indicate drama.

The `☶` actor is...
`/☶` stuck

`|☶` busy

`*☶` eager

`~` sometimes things aren't too clear

`~☶`, I think this is ☶, but not sure

~☶ The presenter can be unclear, 
☶: ~☶ the mood they have can be unclear or 
☶: ~[+-]☶ certain small parts of the mood can be unclear.  
To make these unclear mood indicators very tiny use [[ ]] ~[[+-]]☶, 

> Only using [ ] to denote this might not be considered rude.
