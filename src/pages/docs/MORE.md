### Status Annotation
```
~☶ [
  ☶: I'm busy
  ☶: I'm very busy
]
```
This means that all `actions` from the `actor` _☶_, must be interpreted through the `context` of the `status` listed at the begining.  Often when this is present, the underlying `context` is acertained at a later moment of the `actions` that it describes.
