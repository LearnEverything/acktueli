## Multiplicity

### Multiples
â˜¶ can be one person or multiple `secretive` people
â˜¶â˜¶ can be two or a group of people
â˜¶â˜¶â˜¶ can be three or a large crowd

### Intensity
"â˜¶" as a `reaction` can mean many different things.  However, most of the time it is used as some basic acknowledgement.  An example is just think if someone asked you a question, and to say yes or no, you said your name, like a pokemon.

Pikachu:

`â˜¶ *pika*`

`â˜¶â˜¶ *pikapikapiiika*`

`++â˜¶â˜¶â˜¶ *pikaachooooooo!*`

### Duality

More information about the nature of the duality can be recorded, sometimes an `actor` won't agree with themselves.

> â˜´: { [_]â˜´ && â˜´/+ } *go ahead and redact that & oh that's fine* sometimes you agree with yourself

> â˜´: { [_]â˜´ || â˜´/+ } *go ahead and redact that | oh that's fine* and othertimes, you don't know the right answer

...And even more information can be displayed to show which `reaction` the `actor` views as the "correct" way to `react`.

> â˜´: { [_]â˜´ ||--> â˜´/+ } *go ahead and redact that | oh I'm leaning tword that's fine*

## Grouping ðŸ’»
{ } vs [ ]
{-â˜¶, â˜¶+} indicates simultaneious mood
[-â˜¶, â˜¶+] indicates moods in order
also [-â˜¶.. â˜¶] using the more specific time interval notation

# TODO, how did I notate, *show one thing but feel another type duality*

*messy people don't put spaces between their brackets and their statements*


##
The brackets here represent one member of a group.  Context is important, because here, one `actor` of _legalese_ is muting another `actor` of _legalese_.
