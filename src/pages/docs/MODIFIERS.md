## Modifiers
The use of `modifiers` can affect a `mood` or physical properties of an `action`.

The two basic types of `modifiers` are `mood modifiers`, which is _qualitative_, and `amount modifiers`, which is _quantiative_.  Some characters such as `+` can be as both depending on what it is `modifing`.

### Mood
`Mood modifiers` are usually used in a _reflexive_ context with an `avatar`.

`+` happy or positive

`-` unhappy or negative

`x` anxious

`_` not amused

`o` suprised

### Amount
`+` more

`-` less

`/` half

`[ ]` only a tiny bit

### Composition
Some `modifiers` have special composition rules and are not limited to 1 characters.

_The actor `☶` reacts with..._

`/-☶` *half* unhappy (expresses some duality of emotions or ambivalence)

`[+o]☶` a tiny bit, good suprised

`[---]☶` *only a tiny bit* really, really, very unhappy, or "inside voice"
