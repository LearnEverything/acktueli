## Acktueli

#### === Acktueli ===
As there are many `approaches` in Acktueli, there is only one `approach, #actueli`.

#### Documenter
It's always good to manage expectations.  As a `documenter`, it may not be known which `approach` might be taken or what kind of syntatic or stylistic changes might occur during `documentation` in Acktueli.  Many of the language features are inspired by the English Language, combined with Javascript, which is also an English Languaged based programming language.  Keep that in mind as there might be features of other languages that might be hard to `document` within `#acktueli` and might need a new `approach`.  Even then, there are other parts of Acktueli that are `extensible` meaning set parts of Acktueli that can be changed or replaced, depending on use case.

#### Reader
Sometimes things are hidden and the `reader` must watch closely or they could miss subtlety.  Sometimes provoking a small emotional response is more informative as to the emotion.  The best way to read and understand is to parrallel the emotion that occured.
