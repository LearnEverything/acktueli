#### === Acktueli ===
As there are many `approaches` in Acktueli, there is only one `approach, #actueli`.

### Not Acktueli
Also Acktueli is _extensible_, meaning there are parts to add user content, so there will be unrecognized syntax used elsewhere.  

One of the goals of the structure of Acktueli, is to make it easyish to continue and adding a custom syntax that can mix in other types of notations, expecially other syntax from programming or math.
