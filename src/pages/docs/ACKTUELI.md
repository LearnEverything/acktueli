=== Stäy Tüned ===

Many of the language features are inspired by the English Language, combined with Javascript, which is also an English Languaged based programming language.

> === Acktueli ===
There are many `approaches` in Acktueli, there is only one `approach, #actueli`.

### Not Acktueli
Also Acktueli is _extensible_, meaning there are parts to add user content, so there will be unrecognized syntax used elsewhere.  

One of the goals of the structure of Acktueli, is to make it easyish to continue and adding a custom syntax that can mix in other types of notations, expecially other syntax from programming or math.

### Understanding This Documentation
Acktueli has components of languages from different domains.  While learning about Acktueli, it is helpful to know what part of language Acktueli is trying to represent and the type of domain knowledge inspired Acktueli.

#### `📚: language feature` 
Parts of speech will usually be indicated with a "\_" `closure` like  _part of speech_.  However, not all parts of speech will have their own notation style.

> <<--- What is an _interjection_?

#### `💻: computer science stuff`
Acktueli has a lot of similaries to Javascript.  Care has been taken not too go too far into documenting javascript aspects, but some prerequisite programming information might help Acktueli make more sense.

#### `☕: extensibility`
So far, the extendable parts of Acktueli are dealing with `approaches` or `permanance` and will have a `#` or `$` in front of the type like `#polite` or `$semi-permanant` respectively.  Feel free to define a new `approach` that matches a `documenters` use case.

#### `📏: mathy` 
Like programming, math already has a lot of domain specific notation styles.  Acktueli mostly concerns itself with change over time so understanding how certain types of math functions appear on a graph can come in handy [Easing Functions](https://easings.net/).

#### `👁: visual feels` 
*How many licks it takes to get to the center of a tootsie roll pop?*
> 1, 2, 3: { {(-[ . ]v[ . ]-)} }

Did you 👁 Mr. Owl?

#### `🗪: communication tone` 
Does sarcasm need it's own notation?:

#### `❤: complex emotion`
Some `reactions` are very specific to an `actor` and Acktueli tries to provide a composible way to document complex emotions.
