## Closure
A closure is a set opening and closing characters.  Proper closure is considered important to many `documentors` and `readers`, in `#coding` expecially.

### Feels
To make things confusing, `closures` in general can be subsituted for other characters.  For example, the typical `closure` characters also share the character space as `wave` characters to help denote the enclosed syntax is modified by the `wave`.  Usually, the `[` is nuetral in expressive qualities, so when in doubt, use the `[]` closure.

With `Subtext`, a `documenter` be careful using specific `closures` as they might have `tone` assumptions or affect the `comparison` between the `action` and the `subtext`.

> ☶: +☶?+, {shrugs}
> ☶: +☶?+, _shrugs_
> ☶: +☶?+, |shrugs|
> ☶: +☶?+, [shrugs]
 
### Omission
To confuse `readers` even more, sometimes the `documenter` can omit some `closures` just for `#succinity` or to show a stronger relationship.
