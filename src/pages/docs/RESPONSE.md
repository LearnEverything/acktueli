## Response
### Immediacy
Sometimes conversation goes a little bit quicker or there is a need to show reaction on parts of the sentence.  

### Interjection
> ☶: +☶, I think that's a good idea..
> <-- ☶: -☶-, NO 
The `<--` denotes the strength of the _inerjection_, and the `<interval>` .. is shortened.

### Accord
The documenter may observe that there is a call and echo sort of accord through a conversation.
☶: ☶, omg the new blabla from blabal:☶ was so blabla:☶ and the blabla:☶ was off the blabla:☶.

Other times, there might be a change in tone to see if one is paying attention.  This documented with the `overtone` syntax.

☶: ☶, That desk that I'm talking about is over there#:
<-- ☶: { ☶ }
☶: [_]☶, it is a very good desk and you must study at it
