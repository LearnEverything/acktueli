## Noise
Often, a conversation can get `noisey` and you can loose a `signal`.

## Loudest Noise
In all types of `listening`, there's a good chance that what gets `documented` is the `loudest noise`.  Sometimes this is useful as the `documenter` can listen to a signal of a specific `group` or `channel` and record any `noises` they hear.  Sometimes, it's a lot, sometimes it's a little, but in either situation the `loudest noise` will get recorded so it's nice to be `#polite`.

When the `documenter` is `listening` to a `group` or `channel`, often there are `noisey` unfamiliar `actors`.  If we have no intention of `identifying` the `actor`, we can call this `communication` `anonymous`.  Because of the nature of this, it's best to keep it `#casual`; _kickme_.

# Dreads 

If you don't let it scare you because you might of accidentally touch something gross, you can easily tell the difference if it's a matte or a burr or something else.

# Bias

Other times, we have been conditioned to feel one sort of way or another.  If something hurts us, we are adversarial or avoidant, at least for a while, there no way around that no matter how tough we are.  If we didn't have this involuntary reflex, frankly I wouldn't know how we'd survive as a species.
