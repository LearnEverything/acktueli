### Notation Type 2
`Change over time` can be represented with a different notation.  The <<<=== style of seems more of a `relative` to the previous arrow, where as ↓↑+↑+ feels more `absolute` or independent of each preceding `modifier`.

`Qualitative` type to express more `loudness`

--=-->, `oweoh`
===--> , `ooohhh`
↓↑↓, `oweoh`
↑-↓, `ooohh`

### Rising and Falling Emotion
Rising-falling vs 
↑↑↓↑↓☶, this indicates that someone's reaction might change over time

☶: +☶, @admin, I see that smile!

admin: \_☶↓↑↑↑↑↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓_-☶ 

### Resolution Cross reference
* individual documentation of changes over time, then a summary of the changes over time at the end
```
↑--↓↓↑↑↑ [
/↑↑ 5:17 PM <-△◯->
/↑ 5:17 PM Arbitrat0r: @[cozy] you do not have △ powers yet
/↑ 5:18 PM Arbitrat0r: @[cozy] you do not have △ powers yet
↑↑+ 5:19 PM [cozy]: /o☴++
]
```

#### COMING SOON
There are some graphing tools to use to help show the shape of change over time.
