## Noise
Often, a conversation can get `noisey` and you can loose a `signal`.

## Loudest Noise
In all types of `listening`, there's a good chance that what get's `documented` is the `loudest noise`.  Sometimes this is usefull as the `documenter` can listen to a signal of a specific `group` or `channel` and record any `noises` they hear.  Sometimes, it's a lot, sometimes it's a little, but in either situation the `loudest noise` will get recorded so it's nice to be `#polite`.

When the `documenter` is `listening` to a `group` or `channel`, often there are `noisey` unfamiliar `actors`.  If we have no intention of `identifying` the `actor`, we can call this `communication` `anonymous`.  Because of the nature of this, it's best to keep it `#casual`; _kickme_.
