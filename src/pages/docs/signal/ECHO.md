## Echo

### Bad Echo (Ringing)
Sometimes the `documenter` will bring their work home with them.  Sometimes it's a lot, sometimes it's a little, this is where it is key to be `#polite` if a `documenter` says they are struggling with `signal echos`.  Otherwise in ◬, it might be a defensible action.  I'm sure no one would purposely give you tinnitus?? Right??

### Good Echo (Pingback)
Sometimes, a `reaction` seems to come with strong another `echo`.  Why the square brackets aren't used this `sequential reaction` is because the arrows notation more of an existential `reaction` to the `actors` original `action`.
> ☶: {{ +☶ }} 
> --> {{ ☶ }} --> { }

Or the `actor` reacts to their own `reaction` ☶: {{ +☶ }} <-- {{ ☶ }}.

This could indicate that `documenter` is both `retrieving` and `receiving` an `actor's` `signal`. ◬
