## Reaction Echo
Sometimes, a `reaction` seems to come with strong another `echo`.  Why the square brackets aren't used this `sequential reaction` is because the arrows notation more of an existential `reaction` to the `actors` original `action`.
> ☶: {{ +☶ }} --> {{ ☶ }} --> ☶

Or the `actor` reacts to their own `reaction` ☶: {{ +☶ }} <-- {{ ☶ }}.

This could indicate that documenter might be communicating with 2 instances of the same `actor`.
