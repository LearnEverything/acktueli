## Listening
A `documenter` is paying attention to an `actor` is the same as the `documenter` is listening to the `actor's` `signal`.  As with any conversation, sometimes a `documenter` has to really focus is the `actor's` `signal` is weak.  A `documenter` can improve the `actor's` `signal quality` by simply asking the `actor` to speak up or for everyone else to be `#polite`.

Sometimes it is not clear if the `signal` is `retrieved` or `recieved`.

### Recieved Signal
Listening without a `subject`.  A `documenter` will document all `signals`.

Common signals intercepted:
* `Actors` wanting to `resolve` their `identification`.
* feature requests
* expectations

Unfortunately, these could be `echos` or a `homunuclus`, but there is a slight chance it might not be the previous â—¬.

### Retrieved Signal
Usually there is an objective or sometimes you just want to say Merry Christmas to someone you love.  Sometimes you reach the `homunculus` answering machine.

*What's a `Homunculus`*
> Seems like a small, fully formed `actor`?
