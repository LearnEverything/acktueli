## Listening

### Documenter vs Listener
`Documenting` is typically straight forward and there can be a consensus on what is `documented`.  

However, the role of the `listener` in Acktueli almost becomes an operator in that they focus on `indentifying` `consensus`. 

Sometimes it is not clear is communication is coming though `passive` listening or `active` listening.

### Passive Listening
A `documenter` will document all `signals` however it is a listeners job to attenuate and deattenuate certain `signals`.

### Active Listening
