## ◬ Signal
`Signal` has it's own section because the `documenter` has to take on a new ◬skillset.  The syntax may change in core `Acktueli`, but the reason and purpose might change in ◬ as well as the syntax.  In other words, ◬ may be more of an art than a science now and while core Acktueli takes different `#approaches`, ◬ has different `&processes`.
