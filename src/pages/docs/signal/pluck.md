## Pluck
`Plucking` is almost like starting a new `conversation` about a subject whether it be a `thing` or an `actor`.
> <-- subject -- `documenter`

Usually, the `documenter` is the one `plucking` so their reference can be _implicit_ defined and omitted.
> <-- subject --

### Communication Pluck
`Communication pluck` uses `quick` to listen to `loudest noise` on a given subject.  The `[_closure` indicates this is a `group` of `actors` relating to the _subject_.
```
<-- [subject] ---
  > subject is cool
  < yeah, I agree

---
```

### Image Pluck
`Image Pluck` is â–³.  The `documenter` has to think of the subject and record any `images` that come to mind.
```
<-- ^subject ---
^--> *image description*
```

### Inline Rules
```
<-- ^subject ---
  <-- relating subject ---
    > all the way over here!
    < yup
