## Complex
Compound `reactions` from a single `actor` usually come in 2s and have an extended set of rules to denote the relationship between the `actor's` simultaneous or near simultaneuous `reaction`.

### Duality

More information about the nature of the duality can be documented, sometimes an `actor` won't agree with themselves.

> ☴: { [_]☴ && ☴/+ } *go ahead and redact that & oh that's fine* sometimes you agree with yourself

> ☴: { [_]☴ || ☴/+ } *go ahead and redact that | oh that's fine* and othertimes, you don't know the right answer

...And even more information can be displayed to show which `reaction` the `actor` views as the "correct" way to `react`.

> ☴: { [_]☴ ||--> ☴/+ } *go ahead and redact that | oh I'm leaning tword that's fine*

### Facade

> ☴: { !+☴, ☴- }, that shirt looks good on you!

The +☴ is portraying the reaction the actor has, but really feels ☴-.  Normally this is an && type duality, but || can be used if there is less `granularity`.

### More than 2

If the compound `reaction` contains more than 2 actions, it is more than likely going to represent a `sequence` of `reactions`.

> ☴: [+☴, ☴?-, -☴[-]], Cool, wait what? Oh no I didn't agree to that.

Also `$intervals` can be used between the `reactions` instead of commas to improve `granularity`.
> ☴: [+☴.. ...☴?- ..-☴[-]], Cool, wait what? Oh no I didn't agree to that.
