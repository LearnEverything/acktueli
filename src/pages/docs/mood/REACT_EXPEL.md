## React and Expel
While documenting, there is always a `acting` `actor` and an `targeted` `actor` .  First an `actor` `reacts` internally to a preceeding `action` and then either externalizes that reaction to the `targeted` `actor`, or has a `change` in `mood` after a bit of conscious thinking. The `targeted` `actor` can be _implicit_ or _explicit_.

_Implicit_ `targeted` `actor`, the world.


### React
-☶, an unhappy reaction

### Expel
There doesn't always have to be a change of `mood` between a `react` and `expel`, but there is always _sequentiality_.  Often, the `expel` component is _explicit_.

> ☶: +☶

`Actor` `reacts` positively but also `expels` an `explicit` `positive` `mood`.

If you see a `@` that means `targeted` or specifically `addressed`.

> -☶- @document0r, an unhappy `reaction`, but also `expels` negativity to @document0r.

### Chill Waves
Typically, `chill waves` representation is symmetrical.
> (( document0r )) chilling out

> {{ document0r }} stressing out or alerted

But to imply more complex emotions, an asymetrical 
> ({ act0r )) act0r tries to chill everyone out at the actors own expense
