## Response

### Immediacy
Sometimes conversation goes a little bit quicker or there is a need to show reaction to parts of the `content`.  

### Interjection
> ☶: +☶, I think that's a good idea..
> <-- ☶: -☶-, NO 
The `<--` denotes the strength of the _interjection_.  Also, since this is an _interjection_, the `$interval` of _.._ is is halved.

### Tone Response
☶: ☶, do you agree with me <+☶, okay cool, good to hear <+☶.

*The directionality is implicit_.*

### Accord
The `documenter` may observe that there is a call and echo sort of accord through a conversation.
> ☶: ☶, omg the new blabla from blabal:☶ was so blabla:☶ and the blabla:☶ was off the blabla:☶.
