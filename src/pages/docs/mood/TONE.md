## Tone
Tone is a very nuanced part of language so there are a few ways to express it.  Watch your tone.

Use of `meta`:
> {☴} [☴: +☴, I missed the train, but found a 20 dollar bill.]

Because of the speed at which `tone` might change in a conversation, it's helpful to use `short` notation.

> I think this is a good idea:), so what do you think about it:).

#### Subtext
The first type of `subtext` is a plain text `documentation` of an `action` uses the `** closure`.

```
_☶/x+ *not amused, but go ahead and make an ass of yourself*
++☶?[+] *amused and cautiously optimistic*
++☶ *Lol*.. that was funny.. *looks at document0r*.. I still think it's funny.
```

Also `subtext` can acts as `tags` in `#coding`.

#### Tone Change
There might be a change in `tone` to see if one is paying attention.  While, being `#interactive`, this documented with `short`.

```
☶: ☶, That desk that I'm talking about is over there#:
<-- ☶: { ☶ }
☶: [_]☶, it is a very good desk and you must study at it
```

> The _#:_ is an `actor` that is looking at you to see if you are paying attention, well are you?
