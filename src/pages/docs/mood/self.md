## Self

### Avatar
Often, the `actor's` `reaction` statement will repeat their `identification` like _☶_ in `☶: +☶`.  This is because the `reaction` of the `actor` is _reflexive_, in other words, it must be thought in the `context` of the `actor`.  For example, one actor's sad might just be another actor's normal :.  The repeated _instance_ of the `identification` is the `avatar`.

### Intensity
_☶_ as a `reaction` can mean many different things.  However, in `#acktueli`, most of the time it is used as some _basic acknowledgement_.  An example to think of is if someone asked was asked a question, and to say yes or no, they said their name... like a pokemon.

Pikachu:

`☶ *pika*`

`☶☶ *pikapikapiiika*`

`++☶☶☶ *pikaachooooooo!*`
