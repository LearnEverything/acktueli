## Resolution
`Resolution`, roughly, is the amount of effort a `documenter` puts into `documenting` `actor` or `action` *and* the amount of detail the `documenter` _perceives_ about an `actor` or `action`.

#### Resolve
All to often, while documenting an `actors` responses, other unfamiliar `actors` can injectect or interupt by being `louder` than the `acting actor`.  Sometimes it's quiet, but it is still difficult determine the `actor's` `mood`.  Acktueli donotes this by using the `~`.

> `~☶`, I think this is ☶, but not sure

> `~~~` this is very unclear

```
~☶ The presenter can be unclear, 
☶: ~☶ the mood they have can be unclear or 
☶: ~[+-]☶ certain small parts of the mood can be unclear.  
```

To make these unclear mood `modifiers` very tiny use [[ ]] ~[[+-]]☶, 

*Only using [ ] to denote this might not be considered not `#detailed`.*


#### Loud Noises
Often, the `documenter` does not want `actors` who produce `loud noises` to have `$lasting` `permanance`.  However it is usually `#polite` to indicate `~` next to the interjecting `actor` so that they know they may be butting in.  It could be also the `documenter` doesn't want the `interjecting` actor to be apart of the conversation or be somewhat `#secretive`.  Sometimes, the `documenter` doesn't want to show the `actors` `identification` or take time to `resolve` the `actors` `identification`.
