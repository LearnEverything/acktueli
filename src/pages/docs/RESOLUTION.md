## Resolution


#### Clarity
All to often, while documenting another `actors` responses, there can be other `actors` with unfamiliar signals, or the message's signal strength is weak.  Acktueli donotes this by using the `~`.

  Most of the time, `actors` who produce `noises` are not `<lasting>`.  An `actor statement` will be previxed by a `~` in the conversation, otherwise, their `status` and `identification` would be documented.

`~☶`, I think this is ☶, but not sure

`~~~` this is very unclear

~☶ The presenter can be unclear, 
☶: ~☶ the mood they have can be unclear or 
☶: ~[+-]☶ certain small parts of the mood can be unclear.  
To make these unclear mood indicators very tiny use [[ ]] ~[[+-]]☶, 

> Only using [ ] to denote this might not be considered not `#detailed`.

#### Recognition
The `~` as a status can also represent a new `actor` to conversation.  The reason why it is reused is that, either way, in most cases the `actor` has not been fully `resolved`.
