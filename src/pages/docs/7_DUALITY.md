## Duality
Sometimes, two or more `reactions` can be registered at once:
> ☴: { -☴, +☴ }

Or, sometimes two `actors` can react to the same thing at the same time.
> { ☴: +☴, ☴: -☴ }

More information about the nature of the duality can be recorded, sometimes an `actor` won't agree with themselves.

> ☴: { [_]☴ && ☴/+ } *go ahead and redact that & oh that's fine* sometimes you agree with yourself

> ☴: { [_]☴ || ☴/+ } *go ahead and redact that | oh that's fine* and othertimes, you don't know the right answer

...And even more information can be displayed to show which `reaction` the `actor` views as the "correct" way to `react`.

> ☴: { [_]☴ ||--> ☴/+ } *go ahead and redact that | oh I'm leaning tword that's fine*

## { } vs [ ]
{-☶, ☶+} indicates simultaneious mood
[-☶, ☶+] indicates moods in order
also [-☶.. ☶] using the more specific time interval notation

# TODO, how did I notate, *show one thing but feel another type duality*
