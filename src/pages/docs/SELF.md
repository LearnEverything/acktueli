## Self
Often, the `actor` and the `reaction` statement will repeat the same glyph _☶_ like in `_☶: +☶`.  This is because the `reaction` of the `actor` is _reflexive_, in other words, it must be thought in the `context` of the `actor`, for example, one actor's sad might just be another actor's normal :.

### Intensity
"☶" as a `reaction` can mean many different things.  However, most of the time it is used as some basic acknowledgement.  An example is just think if someone asked you a question, and to say yes or no, you said your name, like a pokemon.

Pikachu:

`☶ *pika*`

`☶☶ *pikapikapiiika*`

`++☶☶☶ *pikaachooooooo!*`

### Address
`^` Similar to reference and value in programming.
@admin //admin proper
^admin //the place where admin is at, or admin's home
