### Identification
`Actors` can choose any `identification` by representing themselves by any glyph, however using `reserved` characters such as `+, -, ?` is considered `#rude`.  So far, Acktueli uses the _☶_ `identification` in this documentation.

### Avatar
Often, in the `reaction` of the `actor` and the statement will repeat their `identification` like _☶_ in `☶: +☶`.  This is because the `reaction` of the `actor` is _reflexive_, in other words, it must be thought in the `context` of the `actor`, for example, one actor's sad might just be another actor's normal :.  We call this repeated _instance_ of the `identification` the `avatar`.

### Intensity
_☶_ as a `reaction` can mean many different things.  However, in `#acktueli`, most of the time it is used as some basic acknowledgement.  An example to think of is if someone asked you a question, and to say yes or no, you said your name, like a pokemon.

Pikachu:

`☶ *pika*`

`☶☶ *pikapikapiiika*`

`++☶☶☶ *pikaachooooooo!*`
