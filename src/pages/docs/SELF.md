## Self

### Address
`^` Similar to reference and value in programming.
@admin //admin proper
^admin //the place where admin is at, or admin's home

### Intensity
"☶" as a `reaction` can mean many different things.  However, most of the time it is used as some basic acknowledgement.  An example is just think if someone asked you a question, and to say yes or no, you said your name, like a pokemon.

Pikachu:

`☶ *pika*`

`☶☶ *pikapikapiiika*`

`++☶☶☶ *pikaachooooooo!*`

## Purposeful Ambiguous Reference
The brackets here represent one member of a group.  Context is important, because here, one `actor` of _legalese_ is muting another `actor` of _legalese_.
