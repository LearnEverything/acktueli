## Direction
To direct something to another `actor` or `thing`, simplely use @ symbol.
> ☶: +☶, @actor

Sometimes, more detail needs to be recorded to describe the increase or decrease of the qualities of an `action` over time.

> ☶: +☶ =--> @actor

This is _☶_ `expelling` _+☶_ to actor, with decreasing momentum and a soft call to attention.

## Wave Shape
Sometimes, the `action` feels that it has a wave shape or that it seasaws between two points

> @actor <--||--> -@☶ 

This indicates a nutral balance while

> @actor <--==||--> -@☶ 

This indicates more weight towards `actor` and using the "||" as a fulcrum.

### Anchor and Momentum

The movement broken down into two parts, the _=--_ `momentum` and the _>_ `anchor`.

`<=-<=-=<` Because there is not a definate `anchor` this can mean there is a `lasting` quality to an `action`.

### Movement
`☶ <<=-=- ☶`, the arrow is usually an expressive form to show rapidness, strength and directionality of the movement.

When transitioning to something else, sometimes there is a speed up or slow down that needs to be recorded.

<-- generic movement

<------- quick traveling, possibly light hearted movement

<<<==== a strong delivery, strong connection

({ admin } <<--- quick light hearted movement of a thing that admin might not be prepared for

> In `( All )`, it's not really annoying to see up to a full line of `resolution` to document direction qualities.

### Notation type 2
Ahhh, use this syntax
☴: {+/↑↑+↓↓/↓↑+↑+☵} && {_[-]☴};☴: +☴
