## Roles

### ðŸ•® - _Reader_
Sometimes things are hidden and the `reader` must watch closely or they could miss subtlety.  Provoking a small emotional response can be more informative as to the emotion that occured, in other words, it might be helpful to laugh at some puns.  The best way to read and understand is to parallel the emotion that occured.

The `Reader` has a few demands:
* Can I === actually === read this?
* Do the syntax variations make sense?
* Don't break rules for no reason.

### âœŽ - _documenter_
It's always good to manage expectations.  As a `documenter`, it may not be known which `approach` might be taken or what kind of syntatic or stylistic changes might occur during `documentation` in Acktueli.
  
Keep that in mind as there might be features of other languages that might be hard to `document` within `#acktueli` and might need a new `approach`.  Even then, there are other parts of Acktueli that are `extensible` meaning set parts of Acktueli that can be changed or replaced, depending on the `documenters` use case or preference.

Don't shoot the `documenter`, they are often tempromental and sometimes they are focused so much on notation they forget to manage expectations on which `approach` to take.

### â—¬ - _Contributor_
First, one must be a `Reader` then they can be a `documenter`, but not unless they are `#acktueli` a `Contributor`.
