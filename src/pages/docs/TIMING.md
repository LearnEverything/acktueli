## Passage of time
The passage of time indicators usually have a logarythmic increase

. very short interval / placeholder for visual purposes

.. short interval or ; when _inline_

... longer interval

..... next interation

If the passage of time indicators are _inline_, that means they are shorter, probably within the range of 5 seconds.

If the passage of time indicators are on a line by themselves, expect at the very least a minute has gone by.

### Connection Emotions
-☶... +☶, that made me unhappy, but i then realized it was the good thing to do.

### Rising and Falling Emotion
↑↑↓↑↓☶, this indicates that someone's reaction might change over time

☶: +☶, @admin, I see that smile!

admin: _☶↓↑↑↑↑↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓_-☶ 

### Weird Sequentiality Rules
There is a lot of loose expression around sequentiality in Ackueli.

In some cases, two statements in close sequence with two before indicators can be nearly summed up with one line instead.

-☶: why did you do that?

-☶: @admin

is similiar too

-☶-: why did you do that @admin?

This can also represent almost a pause for consious examination or an expressive way to show the reactions discrete.

`<-- meta reaction>`
This is the case because someone can react to something, but send out a reaction, the act of sending out that reaction also has a reaction.

Also,
`{☶}: ☶` is similar to `☶: {☶}` but `{☶}: ☶` is more reactionary and `☶: {☶}` is more expelling.
