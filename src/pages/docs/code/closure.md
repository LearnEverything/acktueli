## Closure
A `closure` is a set opening and closing characters.  Proper closure is considered important to many `documentors` and `readers`; in `#coding` especially.

### Feels
`Semantic` `closure` characters can be substituted for more `visually expressive` characters since the typical `#coding` `closure` characters, `{(<` also share the same character space as the `wave` characters in Acktueli.  Sometimes, a little bit of `mood` is needed to be `documented` within the closure.  However, in `#acktueli`, the `[` _feels_ pretty neutral in expressive qualities, so when in doubt, use the `[]` closure.

With `Subtext`, a `documenter` needs to be careful using specific `closures` as they might have `visually expressive` `tone` assumptions.  Also this might change the affect of the `relationship` between the `action` and the `subtext`.

☶: +☶?+, {shrugs}
☶: +☶?+, _shrugs_
☶: +☶?+, |shrugs|
☶: +☶?+, [shrugs]
```
 
### Omission
Sometimes the `documenter` can omit some `closures` just for `#succinity` or to show a stronger relationship.
