## Relations
Relationships can be represented by many `characters`.
```
:
==
===
,
.
```

### Equality
Name value pairs can be used to show that something _is_ something else.

7:02: Admin: @☱ ✔☕: ☯o☯

The equal syntax from javascript can also be used to show `strict` equality or `loose` equality.

Admin == ☱

### Timing
Whenever `.` or `:` or `,` is used, this can affect the timing interpretation of the conversation.
```
: at the same time
, sequential
.. a time interval
```

### Preposition
`[], {}, and ()` are used as _preposition_s which is a type of relationship. 

Usually the `[]` is used as this syntax was inspired by dot notation.

> admin[^house] 
> admin.^house

### Possession
> 2[+]〠@☴

☴ is the owner of 2[+]〠.

If the possession is towards `address`, this means it is more transactional or giving towards the `address`, but something on the right side or away might be more holding or treasured.
