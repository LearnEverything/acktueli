## Rate
Depending on the scenario and dialogue speed, sometimes it is useful to go fast and interject some quick `reactions`.

### Quick
> Hey
> Hey You
> Heeey You HEY HEY
> HEY HEEY HEYHEY
> OMG

Quick can use other _single_ characters to denote different "voices".

> Hi
^ no don't do that
< I think it's alright
^ oh I get it now
> Guys I just wanted to say hi.
