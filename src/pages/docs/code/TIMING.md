## Passage of time
The passage of time `$intervals` usually have a logarithmic increase.

. very short `$interval` / placeholder for visual purposes

.. short `$interval` or ; when _inline_

... longer `$interval`

..... next `$iteration`

If the passage of time `$intervals` are _inline_, that means they are shorter, probably within the range of 5 seconds.

If the passage of time `$intervals` are on a line by themselves, expect at the very least a minute has gone by.

### Connection Emotions
-☶... +☶, that made me unhappy, but I then realized it was the good thing to do.

### Weird Sequentiality Rules
There is a lot of loose expression around how sequentiality is documented in Ackueli.

In some cases, two statements in close sequence with two before `$intervals` can be nearly summed up with one line instead.

-☶: why did you do that?

-☶: @admin

is similiar too

-☶-: why did you do that @admin?

This can also represent almost a pause for conscious examination or an _expressive_ way to show the `reactions` are _discrete_.

Also,
`{☶}: ☶` is similar to `☶: {☶}` but `{☶}: ☶` is more `reactionary` and `☶: {☶}` is more `expelling`.

### _meta reaction_
This is the case because an `actor` can `react` to something, the act of sending out that `reaction` also has a `reaction`.
