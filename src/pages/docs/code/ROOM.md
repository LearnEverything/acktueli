## Room
Sometimes, there are `actions` without an `actor`; these could be `room` messages, _just assume it's probably something important_.

Conversations are always contained within a `room` and sometimes there are `rooms` specifically made to store data about `actors` or `things`.

### Global
An `actors` status change should be considered `global`.
