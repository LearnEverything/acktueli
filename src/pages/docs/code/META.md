## Meta
Sometimes there is the need to display the change of `data` in a conversation.

Usually, the `documenter` will not put a `closure` around the action and the punctiation used can be used to denote sequentiality or relatedness.  In `#reserved` a special dilimeter may be used to seperate the `action` and the `meta`.

// these are really just action without an actor displaying relations between the actors.

### This is meta

A label is an `attribute` that can be added to anything but an `actor`.

### Meta vs Tags vs Labels
Tags and Labels can both be considered `meta`.  The main difference between `meta` and others is that `tags` and `labels` are more sortable where as `meta` might have some kind of `action` or `state` change.
