## Character
Any utf-8 characters can be used in Acktueli. However certain care must be taken because certain characters also have `visually expressive` qualities as well as `notation` qualities.  

Single characters in `notation` can be `composible` to create new `semantic` value.

> + good
> ++ better

Also, while deciding which characters to use in notation, they usually follow the more is more principle.  
> two lines, = is more than one line, -

### Visually Expressive Qualities
Characters in a series are already used in a visual expressive way in `#notacktueli`, _:-)_.  However, in Acktueli, single character's visual impact must also be taken into account, not just when characters are in a series. For example, `(` looks more _chill_ than `{` or `O` could represent more or larger than `o`.

`Visually expressive` characters used represent `qualitative` values, however it is not considered `#detailed` to use them as `quantitative` representations.  For example, `+` is generally interpreted as good or more, but `+.+`... is that a beached squid or is the `documenter` adding things together?

### Documenter's Choice
There might be certain characters used in `#acktueli` that have a reserved meaning for other communication platforms.  For instance the `@` symbol is used in differentor there is characters used beyond what `#actueli` defines.

Depending on the _domain_ or `use case` the `documenter` is in, arrows, for example, can represent different things.  `(=-` can represent a convex lense on a video camera to zoom in or `[]` might specicially give direction about what kind of gel to use.

Also, `「」『』` are some pretty cool looking characters, however it is not on my keyboard so it's hard to get to, so I haven't written about it... but I should use it more often.
