## Short

### The main rule of `short` notation it that it is only *two* characters in a series.

Because it is so `short`, it can be used _anywhere_ and in the place of other `notations`.  Since `short` is also `#concise`, a `documenter` can use it in many places to improve readability where other `#detailed` notations might not be `#quick` enough to the `reader`.

### Visual
While being `#casual`, `short` can have a `visually expressive syntax` using variations of two character `smiley faces`.

### Semantic
However, `short` doesn't always have to use `smiley faces`, instead a `documenter` can use a `short` counting system.

### Mood Short
A `documenter` can use a *two character* `mood` as well.  However, when using `mood short` it's almost documented as some type of `#quick` `reaction`.
