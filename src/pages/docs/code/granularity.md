## Granularity
How much detail is too much?  In order for a `documenter` to to keep up with a conversation during `documentation`, a focus on `granularity` is essential.

### Repeating Glyphs
Using more than three repeating glyphs usually is considered excessive in `#casual`, `#strict`, and `#polite`.  This is because of the `#actueli` balance between `granularity` and notation speed.  However in `#rude` or `#detailed`, you can do whatever you'd like.  5 repeating glyphs can also indicate 11.
