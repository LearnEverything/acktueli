## Attributes
Attributes are used to store data about an `actor` or `thing` that is `$semi-permanant`, `$permanant` but not `$lasting`.

`Owner` always is put last.

### Leader
If one `actor` is accompanying another `actor`, it can be shown that the accompanying actor is an `attribute`.

### Preposition

`[], {}, and ()` are used as prepositions which feel similiar to `attributes`.   In fact, being _of something_ could be considered an `attribute` and a _preposition_.
