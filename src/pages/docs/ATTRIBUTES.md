## Attributes
Sometimes, data can be stored about an `actor` or `thing` that is `<semi-permanant>`, `<permanant>` but not `<lasting>`.

`Owner` always is put last.

### Leader
If one `actor` is accompanying another `actor`, it can be shown that the accompanying actor is an `attribute`.

### Location
`Location` is a `<semi-permanant>` `attribute`.  To reference the location of something use ^.  For instance, ^☶ could mean the home of ☶ or where ☶ is currently.

☶: ☶?? --> ^☶ Where'd I put my keys?
