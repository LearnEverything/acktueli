## Rate
Depending on the scenario and dialogue speed, sometimes it is useful to go fast and interject some quick `reactions`.

### Quick
> Hey
> Hey You
> Heeey You HEY HEY
> HEY HEEY HEYHEY
> OMG

> Becareful with this one, using too much `quick` can almost defeat the purpose of Acktueli.

### Resolution
Using more than three glyphs usually is considered excessive in `casual`, `strict`, and `polite`.  This is because of the balance between granularity and notation speed.  However in `rude` or `detailed`, you can do whatever you'd like.
