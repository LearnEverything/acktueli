## Change Over Time
Sometimes, more detail needs to be recorded to describe the how `action` _changed over time_.

## Seasaw
Sometimes, the `action` feels that it seasaws between two points.

> @actor <--||--> -@☶ 

This indicates a nutral balance while

> @actor <--==||--> -@☶ 

This indicates more weight towards `actor` and using the "||" as a fulcrum.

### Anchor and Momentum

The movement broken down into two parts, the _=--_ `momentum` and the _>_ `anchor`.

`<=-<=-=<` Because there is not a definate `anchor` this can mean there is `<lasting>` to the `action`.

### Movement
`☶ <<=-=- ☶`, the arrow is usually an expressive form to show rapidness, strength and directionality of the movement.

When transitioning to something else, sometimes there is a speed up or slow down that needs to be recorded.

<-- generic movement

<------- quick traveling, possibly light hearted movement

<<<==== a strong delivery, strong connection

({ admin } <<--- quick light hearted movement of a thing that admin might not be prepared for

> In `( All )`, it's not really annoying to see up to a full line of `resolution` to document direction qualities.

### Notation Type 2
`Change over time` can be represented with a different notation.  The <<<=== style of seems more of a `relative` to the previous arrow, where as ↓↑+↑+ feels more `absolute` or independant of each preceeding indicator.

`Qualitative` type to express more `loudness`

--=-->, `oweoh`
===--> , `ooohhh`
↓↑↓, `oweoh`
↑-↓, `ooohh`

### Rising and Falling Emotion

Rising-falling vs expanding-contracting
↑↑↓↑↓☶, this indicates that someone's reaction might change over time

☶: +☶, @admin, I see that smile!

admin: \_☶↓↑↑↑↑↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓_-☶
