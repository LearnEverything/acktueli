## Change over Time
Sometimes, more detail needs to be documented to describe the how `action` _changed over time_.

### Seasaw
Sometimes, the `action` feels that it seasaws between two points.

> @actor <--||--> -@☶ 

This indicates a nuetral balance while

> @actor <--==||--> -@☶ 

This indicates more weight towards `actor` and using the "||" as a fulcrum.

### Anchor and Momentum

The movement broken down into two parts, the _=--_ `momentum` and the _>_ `anchor`.

`<=-<=-=<` Because there is not a definate `anchor` this can mean there is `$lasting` to the `action`.

### Movement
`☶ <<=-=- ☶`, the arrow is usually an expressive form to show rapidness, strength and directionality of the movement.

When transitioning to something else, sometimes there is a speed up or slow down that needs to be documented.

<-- generic movement

<------- quick traveling, possibly light hearted movement

<<<==== a strong delivery, strong connection

({ admin } <<--- quick light hearted movement of a thing that admin might not be prepared for

> In `( All )`, it's not really annoying to see up to a full line of `resolution` to document direction qualities.

### Notation Type 2
`Change over time` can be represented with a different notation.  The <<<=== style of seems more of a `relative` to the previous arrow, where as ↓↑+↑+ feels more `absolute` or independant of each preceeding `modifier`.

`Qualitative` type to express more `loudness`

--=-->, `oweoh`
===--> , `ooohhh`
↓↑↓, `oweoh`
↑-↓, `ooohh`

### Is it an <interval> or <repeating>?
Normally, it is `polite` to use only 3 repeating glyphs in a `status`.  Usually when you see 1 - 3 of `↓` it is `$semi-permanant`, sometimes, when things are `#fun` it could represent something `$repeating`, however 5 or more could represent an `$interval`.

### Rising and Falling Emotion
Rising-falling vs expanding-contracting
↑↑↓↑↓☶, this indicates that someone's reaction might change over time

☶: +☶, @admin, I see that smile!

admin: \_☶↓↑↑↑↑↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓_-☶
