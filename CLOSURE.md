 ## Closure
 A closure is a set opening and closing characters.  Proper closure is considered important to many `documentors` and `readers`, in `#coding` expecially.

 To make things confusing, different closures can be subsituted for `wave` characters to help denote the enclosed syntax is modified by the `wave`.  Usually, the `[` is nuetral in expressive qualities, so when in doubt, use the `[]` closure.
 
 #### Omission
 To confuse `readers` even more, sometimes the `documenter` can omit some `closures` just for `#succinity` or to show a stronger relationship.
