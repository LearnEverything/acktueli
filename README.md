--â˜¶ very unhappy

---â˜¶ really, really, very unhappy

### React and Expel

-â˜¶- @admin, an unhappy reaction, but also expels negativity to admin

## Emotion Modifiers

?--â˜¶ *questioning* very unhappiness

#â˜´ contemplation without reaction or expelation

### Clarification
_â˜¶/x+ *not amused, but go ahead and make an ass of yourself*

### Clarity
~ sometimes things aren't too clear

~â˜¶, I think this is â˜¶, but not sure

### Waves
(( admin )) chilling out

{{ admin }} stressing out

({ admin )) admin was stressing out a little, but admin chills things out a bit

## Politeness
* It is polite to only repeat 1 indicator in sequence 3 times ie +++â˜¶ not ++++++â˜¶.

### Duality of Emotion
{ [_]â˜´ & â˜´/+ } *go ahead and redact that & oh that's fine* sometimes you agree with yourself

{ [_]â˜´ | â˜´/+ } *go ahead and redact that | oh that's fine* and othertimes, you don't know the right answer

*messy people don't put spaces between their brackets and their statements*

## Passage of time
The passage of time indicators usually have a logarythmic increase

. very short interval / placeholder for visual purposes

.. short interval or ; when _inline_

... longer interval

..... next interation

If the passage of time indicators are _inline_, that means they are shorter, probably within the range of 5 seconds.

If the passage of time indicators are on a line by themselves, expect at the very least a minute has gone by.

### Connection Emotions
-â˜¶... +â˜¶, that made me unhappy, but i then realized it was the good thing to do.

### Rising and Falling Emotion
â†‘â†‘â†“â†‘â†“â˜¶, this indicates that someone's reaction might change over time

â˜¶: +â˜¶, @admin, I see that smile!

admin: _â˜¶â†“â†‘â†‘â†‘â†‘â†“â†“â†“â†“â†“â†“â†“â†“_-â˜¶ 

### Weird Sequentiality Rules
There is a lot of loose expression around sequentiality in Ackueli.

In some cases, two statements in close sequence with two before indicators can be nearly summed up with one line instead.

-â˜¶: why did you do that?

-â˜¶: @admin

is similiar too

-â˜¶-: why did you do that @admin?

This can also represent almost a pause for consious examination or an expressive way to show the reactions discrete.

`<-- meta reaction>`
This is the case because someone can react to something, but send out a reaction, the act of sending out that reaction also has a reaction.

Also,
`{â˜¶}: â˜¶` is similar to `â˜¶: {â˜¶}` but `{â˜¶}: â˜¶` is more reactionary and `â˜¶: {â˜¶}` is more expelling.

## Having Things
â˜¶[Ackueli] â˜¶ owns Ackueli

### Movement
â˜¶ <<=-=- â˜¶, the arrow is usually an expressive form to show rapidness, strength and directionality of the movement

<-- generic movement

<------- quick traveling, possibly light hearted movement

<<<==== a strong delivery

({ admin } <<--- quick light hearted movement of a thing that admin might not be prepared for
